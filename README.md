# Epileptic-Seizure-Detection
## Intro Of This Notebook

The aim of this study is to diagnose epileptic seizures by using different machine learning algorithms. 
For this purpose, the frequency components of the EEG are extracted by using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and parametric methods based on autoregressive (AR) model. 
Both these two feature extraction methods are applied to the input of machine learning classification algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Naive Bayesian, k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression,Principal Component Analysis. 
The results show that k-NN, ANN and SVM were the most efficient method according to test processing of both DWT and AR as feature extraction for recognition of epileptic seizures in EEG.
## Introduction Of Epileptic

Epilepsy is a serious brain illness that is an endemic neurological disorder all over the world. 
It is a clinical result that occurs with abnormal neurological electrical discharging of brain. 
Epileptic seizures represent the most common positive signs and symptoms of brain disturbance, and epilepsy is one of the most common primary brain disorders . Vascular causes, traumatic causes, infections and brain abscesses, brain tumors, nutritional deficiencies, pyridoxine deficiency, calcium metabolism disorders are lead causes for epilepsy. 
For in diagnosing epilepsy, research is needed for better understanding of mechanisms causing epileptic disorders. 
The evaluation and treatment of neurophysiologic disorders are diagnosed with the electroencephalogram [EEG]. 
EEG is crucial for accurate classification of different forms of epilepsy .
